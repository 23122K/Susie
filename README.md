# About the project
As part of the requirements for obtaining an engineering degree, we are obliged to create a solution that is fully operational by the end of the project.

<b>The multiplatform computer system for supporting basic Scrum activities</b> - thats our thesis, and that how Susie came to be.
Our primary goal from the perspecitve of our Engenirring thesis it to demonstrate that it is possible to create solution for supporting basic scrum acticities,
including functionalities of scrum team management, work management (creating, ordering, managing the tasks, product and sprint backlog), analysing Sprint workflow based on existing form of data presentation – cumulative flow chart.
While also providing functionalities to manage individual tasks (status, progress, type, description) and adding comments in scope of each of them.
Moreover, we want to provide tools for efficient execution of scrum events – Planning, Review, Retrospective. Which are all the phillars of the Scrum Framework.
